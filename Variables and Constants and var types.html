<!-- Define variables: var and let 
    The difference between let and var is in the scope of the variables they create: 
    Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined.
     Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared-->
<!-- var username; -->

<!-- let username; -->

<!-- Assigning the value to variable-->

<!--
    var username;
    username = "Tom";
-->
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>google.com</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        let username;           // Define the var username
        username = "Tom";       // Assign the value to var
        console.log(username);  // Print the var to console
    </script>
</body>
</html> -->

<!-- Constants
The const keyword can be used to define a constant , which, like a variable, holds a value, but the value cannot be changed.


const username = "Tom"; -->



<!-- Interpolation Using slash quotes allows us to use a technique called interpolation - embedding data into a string. For example: -->
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>google.com</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      const user = "Tom";
      const text = `Name: ${user}`;
      console.log(text); // Name: Tom
    </script>
  </body>
</html> -->
<!--You can embed more data in a similar way:
const user = "Tom";
const age = 37;
const isMarried = false;
const text = `Name: ${user}   Age: ${age}   IsMarried: ${isMarried}`;
console.log(text);  // Name: Tom   Age: 37   IsMarried: false
-->

<!--
    In addition to interpolation, slash quotes allow you to define multi-line text:
const text = 
`We all learned a little
Something and somehow
So upbringing, thank God,
It's easy for us to shine.`;
 
console.log(text);
-->

<!--
  object
The type objectrepresents a complex object. The simplest definition of an object is curly braces:
const user = {};
An object can have various properties and methods:
const user = {name: "Tom", age:24};
console.log(user.name);
In this case, the object is called user, and it has two properties,
 name and age, which accept data of other types as values.
  This is a brief description of objects, we will consider objects in more detail in subsequent articles.

<!--
  Weak/dynamic typing
JavaScript is a weakly and dynamically typed language. This means that variables can dynamically change type. For example:

1
2
3
4
5
6
let id;  // тип undefined
console.log(id);
id = 45;  // тип number
console.log(id);
id = "45"; // тип string
console.log(id);
Despite the fact that in the second and third cases the console will display the number 45, 
in the second case the variable idwill represent a number, and in the third case it will represent a string.

typeof operator
Using the typeof operator , you can get the type of a variable, which can be useful when, depending on the type of a variable, you need to perform certain actions:
let id;
console.log(typeof id);       // undefined
 
id = 45;
console.log(typeof id);   // number
 
id = 45n;
console.log(typeof id);     // bigint
 
id = "45";
console.log(typeof id);     // string
It's worth noting that for a null value, the operator typeofreturns "object",
 even though according to the JavaScript specification, null represents a distinct type.
